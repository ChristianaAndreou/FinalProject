783,Ancient building.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,
784,And a toilet too close to the sink difficult to sit for adults.,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
785,"And a very small sign, passed the hotel twice, got there late in the evening, the phone was dead, so there was inconvenience with the search.",,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
786,And also after 2 months it was noted and I was assigned such a room.,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
787,And also didn't get any fresh towels on 6 day stay.,,1,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
788,"And an  la carte portion (cold meat, eggs, rolls/bread) with regional products.",1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
789,And at night you feel a bit afraid to walk in front of the hotel.,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
790,And Copenhagen central station in 10 min.,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
791,"And due to heat, windows needed to stay open.",,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
792,And eggs are served at the table no waiting.,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
793,"And eventually you have to take a small lift to the 11th floor, there are the rooms.",,1,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
794,"And for the price in the center of Copenhagen, that was very good.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,
795,And friendly place.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
796,"And if possible then would be good to have at least one English-based TV program (don't speak and understand Danish, French, or Spanish).",,1,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
797,And Location was amazing.,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
798,And the coffee is GREAT.,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
799,And the kindness and availability of the staff.,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
800,And the nice idea with the Plastic bundles are nice.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
801,And the parking is not free for guests.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,
802,"And the price of the room is extremely good, so these are only ideas and no criticism at all!! ",1,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,
803,And the reception closed earlier than the stated time (so I didn't get my evening beer?).,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
804,"And the room is extremely small, we cant even unfold 2 luggages easily.",,1,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
805,And the shower was very small you could hardly move.,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,

817,"Annoying noise at night, probably related to the malfunction of the ventilation system.",,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
818,Another bed had a mattress protector that was damp and badly laid.,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
819,"Another benefit was the central location of the hotel which enabled only a short walk to lots of dinning and entertainment areas of Salzburg, an exceptionally beautiful city.",1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
820,Another disturbing factor is that for two glasses of wine we had to pick up 22 euros at the hotel bar.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,
821,Another reason is that these hotel rooms are too small.,,1,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
822,Another strong point of the structure is the strategic position from which you can reach all the interesting places to visit on foot.,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
823,Another tip for the hotel management - maybe find out beforehand before you are unfriendly to your guests - there are booking partner sites which I found on Google.,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

16803,The only complaint we have it that the large window in the room has no soundproofing at all!!,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
16804,The only disappointing thing was the pool (expected it to be bigger) but it was okay.,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16805,"The only down fall was the shower, It needs a longer screen so water don't spray out.",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
16806,"The only down point was that there was no wifi on the rooms and the hotel was a bit far from the center, however underground was near and there was a bus stop just in front of the hotel.",,1,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,1,,1,

16808,The only downside is the noise.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
16809,The only downside that after a long flight we had to to wait 3h for check despite of informing the hotel of the time of our arrival.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
16810,The only downside to this booking was how sound travelled through the walls.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,

16813,The only downside was we didn't have hot water for showering.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,

16815,The only drawback: room a bit noisy.,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
16816,The only drawback: there were hairs in the corner of the toilet.,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
16817,"The only flaw before flight of stairs without elevator, breakfast was not too varied.",,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,
16818,"The only flaw for me was the mattress, too soft, and it woke up my back pain.",,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
16819,The only flaw I can say is the noise of some extractor placed in the rooms that should be replaced with more silent as these background noises are heard in the early hours of the morning and during the early hours of the night.,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
16820,"The only flaw is not very convenient to the center but, in a short time, you can reach any destination of the city by tram and metro.",,,1,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,

16823,The only flaw is the distance from the center.,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16824,The only flaw was really very hot in the rooms and you could not get the temperature to drop.,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

16826,The only flaw was the change of towels at least once a day it would be perfect. For the rest ok.,,,1,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16827,The only flaw was the closure of the reception and consequently of the structure at 8pm resulting in the entrance via the garage.,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,
16828,"The only flaw, a bit far walk from Barcelona beach.",,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
16829,"The only flaw, but that does not depend on the hotel, is the proximity to Piazza Garibaldi which sometimes gives a feeling of insecurity, but was easily avoided by using the bus that practically leaves you in front of the hotel.",,,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16830,"The only flaw, there was no buffet service for breakfast but there are plenty of cafes around.",,,1,,,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,
16831,"The only flaw: we had to check in at another facility, 15 minutes walk from the b&b.",,1,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,

16833,"The only good points were the central location and the comfy beds, but it is definitely not worth the price we paid for this hotel which is in my opinion a 3 stars hotel at the very best.",1,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,1,,,1,
16834,The only good thing abt this place is its near the central station.,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16835,The only good thing seemed the bathroom.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
16836,The only issue I had it was the rooms they are not sound proof.,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
16837,The only issue was that we could not have breakfast at the hotel even if they provided us with vouchers for nice little boats in the area with excellent pastries.,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16838,"The only minor setback was the bed, which was two smaller ones put together,.",,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
16839,"The only minus was that the walls were really thin and my room was close to the lift, so I heard the lift and in the morning I heard the kitchen stacking plates.",,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,1,,,,,
16840,"The only negative is that the room smelled like garlic, I still don't know why.",,1,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16841,The only negative note is the lack of balcony room.,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16842,The only negative point are the pillows.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,
16843,"The only point is the waiting for elevators, giving all rooms are high and only some elevators were working.",,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,
16844,The only point that we didn't like is a very small shower (in a very big bathroom).,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
16845,"The only positive note is the strategic location of the structure located a few meters from Piazza del Plebiscito, well served by restaurants, bars, shops of all kinds and grocery.",1,,,,,,1,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,
16846,The only positive would be the driver who took us from the check in location to the ?hotel? - yes this is not a typical hotel & you cannot walk to the location of the room.,1,,,,,,1,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,
16847,The only problem in our case was the noise.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
16848,The only problem was the construction/repairment before 8 am in the morning.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16849,"The only problem--reception is in a totally different location, so go there first.",,1,,,,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16850,The only real flaw is that the bathroom lacks some accessories.,,1,,,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
16851,The only reason it is not a 10 is that it was a little bit too noisy.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
16852,"The only small downside was the bathroom, it was quite cramped.",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
16853,The only small negative is the glass door at the bathroom.,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
16854,The only small negative was a slightly cramped bathroom.,,1,,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
16855,The only small window facing a closed hallway.,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16856,"The only thing I can complain about it having a single bed, I think all beds in hotels should be doubles regardless of if it?s a solo traveller or not.",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,

16863,The only thing missing was a fridge in the room but that would not keep me from choosing again this hotel.,,1,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16864,The only thing that felt everything from the other room!,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,
16865,"The only thing that I can mention is that the towels were remove everyday, it wasn?t necessary.",,1,,1,,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,
16866,The only thing that was good about it was the view.,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16867,The only thing to add would be to clean the windows.,,1,,1,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16868,The only thing was that the air in the rooms was very dry so that was hard on my friend?s throat and breathing.,,1,,,,1,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

16874,"The only thing we were told was that parking would have cost ? 20, whereas at the time of payment we were told it was 25? because the car was big!",,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,,,,

16878,The only window faced to the inner place and you could see the opposite room.,,1,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
