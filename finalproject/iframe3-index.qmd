### 1. Introduction to the Project
üëã **Hotel Reviews Analytics**  
 
**Analyzing Hotel Reviews with Sentiment Analysis & Topic Modeling**

Project Overview:
This project builds upon work I completed during my PhD, where I gathered and analyzed 23,114 reviews from 42 hotels located in Italy, Austria, Spain, and Denmark. The dataset includes reviews across a variety of categories such as cleanliness, location, staff, comfort, breakfast, etc. <br>
The main goal was to apply Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling to derive insights into customer experiences and the performance of the hotels.

### 7. Key Design Choices (i)
***1. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis***:  
- ***Why***: Hotels want to know not just whether a review is positive or negative, but which aspects (cleanliness, staff, location, etc.) are contributing to these sentiments.
- ***How***: 
  - Used a list of keywords for each aspect (e.g., ‚Äúclean,‚Äù ‚Äúspotless‚Äù for cleanliness).
  - Reviews were categorized based on keyword matches.

### 7. Key Design Choices (ii)
***2. Visualizing Sentiment by Aspect***:
- **Why**: This helps identify which aspects of the hotel have the most positive or negative sentiments and allows management to focus on specific areas.
- ***How***: 
  - Used **ggplot2** (and later `plotly` for interactivity) to visualize sentiment distribution.
  - Also used bar plots to show the proportion of sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) per aspect.

---

### 8. Visualization of Sentiment Distribution
***Bar Plots***:
- ***Bar Plot***: Shows the sentiment distribution for each aspect (e.g., "Cleanliness," "Staff," "Location").

***Key Insights from Visualization***:
- ***Positive Sentiments***: Certain aspects like "Staff" and "Location" may consistently have higher positive sentiment, indicating strengths.
- ***Negative Sentiments***: Aspects like "Cleanliness" or "Noise" might often show negative sentiment, suggesting areas for improvement.

### 9. Word Cloud Analysis
**Purpose**:  
- A **word cloud** was created for **positive reviews** based on aspects like "cleanliness," "staff," and "comfort."
- **Design Choices**: 
  - Frequent terms were shown in larger fonts to highlight the most common words associated with positive feedback.
  - This allows a quick visual representation of what customers most appreciate about specific hotel features.

---

### 10. Interactive Features
**Interactivity Added**:  
- **Interactive Bar Plot**:
  - Users can **click** on any sentiment category to filter and view related reviews.
  - **Hover** over the bars to get exact counts and proportions for each sentiment.
  
**Why**:  
- Making the chart interactive allows users to engage more deeply with the data, offering them customized insights for each hotel aspect.
